<p id="Ireland">Ireland is a beautiful country rich in culture and history, and is a great travel destination! You can visit the busy streets of Dublin and drive two hours away to see the dramatic cliffs in Connamore. Or, visit the beautiful beach towns or the farm estates with amazing homemade pastries. Here are some specific suggestions that hopefully will convince you on why Ireland is the perfect destination for YOU!!!!! (i'm biased) </p>
